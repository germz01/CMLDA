## Assignment
(M) is a NN with topology and activation function of your choice, provided it is differentiable. 
* (A1) is a standard momentum descent approach [references: [On the importance of initialization and momentum in deep learning](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/momentum.pdf)].
* (A2) is an algorithm of the class of Conjugate Gradient methods [references: J. Nocedal, S. Wright, Numerical Optimization, [A new conjugate gradient algorithm for training neural networks based on a modified secant equation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0096300313007558)].
